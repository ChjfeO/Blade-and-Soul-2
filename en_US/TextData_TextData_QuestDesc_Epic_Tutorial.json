        "text": "A stone that cuts through the sky and closes cracks. A thousand moon fertility. \nWhen Arang said that he would participate in a martial arts competition to obtain that mysterious crystal, my heart started pounding. This time is the world out of this mountain. On the way, we packed our bags and followed Arang to Vandal Lake, where the martial arts competition was held.\n\nBy the way, what was this? It was strange that there was a crack in such a place, but then a flame hwan appeared. The flame was absorbed and re-injected by Sura, and it had a much stronger power than the fire man. I may have suffered a serious injury before even participating in the competition.\n\nSince then, strange and strange things have happened. The Balbali that I saved from the burnout has become a soul and resides in me. I heard it.\n\nThe martial arts venue has arrived after many twists and turns. Thinking about the preliminaries that will start soon, I feel a little nervous. Shall we get some weapons and warm up a bit?"
