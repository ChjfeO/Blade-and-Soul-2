After that, a huge fertility was discovered by the expedition, and it is said that there was an unfortunate accident in the process of harvesting this fertility. After that, the story of the jungle losing its original color and light and becoming the gray jungle it is today can be found in the expedition's exploration records.\nWe believe that this does not apply only to the jungle environment. It is speculated that it may have had an effect on the living creatures that had settled there. A representative example is platinum gold, which is staying in a hideout of disaster.\nIt also lost its color and light due to an unfortunate accident and is now active only in dark places. I think it may have turned into a monster, with a lot of hostility towards humans. There are still incidents where a trainee who occasionally patrols this place is killed by platinum.

The rearing side took the position that they could not provide a reward because the pioneering was not finished yet, and the Hongdon tribe eventually lost patience and left the expedition.
