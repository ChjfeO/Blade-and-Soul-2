    "20000901": "I think that's a martial arts venue over there.",
    "20000902": "What are you looking forward to already?\nLet's get started!",
    "20000903": "Shh! <textColor=[215:94:94:255]>You bastards</>.\nIt's like there's a crack in a place like this...",
    "20000904": "(Something seems to be under attack...)",
    "20000905": "(Lend me a weapon)",
    "20000906": "Oh, right. Are you empty-handed now?",

    "20000908": "(Okay)",
    "20000909": "I'll take a look around here!\nBe careful.",

    "20000916": "Yes! Are you a participant in a martial arts competition?\nYou came very quickly~",
    "20000917": "It's still too early for the martial arts competition to start.\nIf that's okay, why don't you warm up and warm up nearby?",
    "20000918": "(That would be nice.\nBut I didn't have a weapon yet...can I borrow a weapon?)",
    "20000919": "Yes! We are lending swords for such participants~\nIt's not a famous sword, but it's strong enough to be used before a match.",
