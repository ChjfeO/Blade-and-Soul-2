    "200010360": "Please, please.\nPlease save as many skins and teeth as possible!",
    "200010361": "To bring so many...!\nIf we wear our warriors and listen to them, we can still afford it.",
    "200010362": "Thank you very much. I will definitely remember the day I received the help of\n<textColor=[255:204:102:255]><myHero.name/></> on the day to retake our village someday. Suwa!",
    "200010363": "You see that <textColor=[110:216:175:255]>deep pit</> over there? Collect and bring various <textColor=[255:204:102:255]>samples</> over there It's work.\nThe more you have, the more you pay! How about you? Would you like to try it?",
    "200010364": "I feel uncomfortable being entrusted with a dangerous job, but please take care of me.\nI will visit my family as soon as possible.",
    "200010365": "<textColor=[255:204:102:255]><myHero.name/></>, there seem to be other corridors of awakening in this area as well.\nActually, I was the first to come out and watch. There is one place...",
    "200010366": "Can't you-see over there?\nCan you come and visit me first while I'm looking around?",
    "200010367": "(Ask if you don't want to go in person)",
    "200010368": "Well, I know that you can also pass through the Awakening Corridor.\nIt would be quickest to find them scattered.",
    "200010369": "Besides, there must be something special about you.\nIf you walk around the corridor, you might find out why.",
    "200010370": "(I will try)",
    "200010371": "Okay, the road to get there looks more difficult than it looks, so it would be better to go to the front of the corridor in Chukjiji.\nDon't forget to let us know when you find fertility! See you later!",
    "200010372": "Oh, was there a corridor of awakening in such a place as well?",
    "200010373": "<textColor=[255:204:102:255]><myHero.name/></>, have you been there already?",
    "200010374": "(Not yet)",
    "200010375": "Okay. You found it first, so let's go.\nI'll look elsewhere.",
    "200010376": "Oh, if you ever find fertility, call me.\nI'll find you anywhere in the corridor at once.",
    "200010377": "(As a researcher, it must have been quite appealing, but I say it's a shame)",
    "200010378": "That's what I mean. But it's frustrating that you can't wander around that pit where \nthe pits are infested with bonfires in search of fairy tales that you don't even know where they are.",
    "200010379": "Would you mind looking for some fairy tales? I don't need many.\nOne... or two? If you give me the words written in the fairy tales, I will reward you.",
    "200010380": "(Describes the tales found in the Void Pit)",
    "200010381": "The value given by the small cooperative is enough as a feed.\nThank you very much. Here is the reward.",
    "200010382": "Hey, we learn everything from our textbooks. What... Really! Can I have this?\nIf I get my hands on it, I might be able to use it! Haha~",
    "200010383": "(These are human footprints. It looks like they walked into the canyon.\nA person in this place? Why? What is the cause? Curious)",
    "200010004": "Hey ah ~ my window because the drill ah? \nshield yajiyi bored!"
