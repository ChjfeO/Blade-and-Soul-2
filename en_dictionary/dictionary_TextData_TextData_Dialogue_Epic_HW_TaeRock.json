    "20020381": "Oh, if you can afford it, I'd appreciate some samples.",
    "20020382": "<textColor=[215:94:94:255]>Pineapple</> or something. Isn't it?",
    "20020383": "(Still say you shouldn't be vigilant)",
    "20020384": "Then I will believe you.",
    "20020385": "Leave it to me!",
    "20020386": "Thank you! I hope this clears things up a bit.",
    "20020387": "(You say you want it)",
    "20020388": "Come on, I'm done with all the work... Shall we go back to <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Pungbaekmun</>?",
    "20020389": "That's right, Lord Moon. The way to <textColor=[110:216:175:255]>Fertile Land</> is now blocked.",
    "20020390": "What kind of bullshit is that?",
    "20020391": "It is said that on the way to the <textColor=[110:216:175:255]>Red Slope</>, cannibals grew and formed a wall. \nHaha, everything happened when Master Moon came. yes",
    "20020392": "What does that have to do with me! Ha... What about this?",
    "20020393": "(Ask to find out the problem)",
    "20020394": "Then we'll see you at <textColor=[110:216:175:255]>Red Slope</> after the problem is resolved. \nI'll come back with some personal affairs first.",

    "20020399": "Something seems to be happening in <textColor=[110:216:175:255]>Paradise Valley</> as well. \nIf you're interested, it wouldn't be a bad idea to go there.",
    "20020400": "Who else did you promise?",
    "20020401": "You're here! Are you really ready?",
    "20020402": "(say yes)",
    "20020403": "Then let's go! Now, let's go to our respective positions!",

    "20020406": "(You're late, so I'll go first!)",
    "20020407": "Anyway... <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Biryuha</> The death penalty is always the same. \nBeing an elder doesn't change anything~",
    "20020408": "(Ask if that's a good thing)",
    "20020409": "Is that so~? Actually, I haven't changed either. Haha.",
    "20020410": "(Ask to explain what happened by the way)",
    "20020411": "Oh, didn't I tell you? Haha... As you can see, I'm the owner of <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Pungbaekmun</>. \nI'm <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Regressor of Shiro</>, <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Pungbaekmun</> is <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Shiro</> is the beginning... of course I knew...",

    "20020414": "(Unknown energy flows out, but somehow it feels familiar)",
    "20020415": "Shall we go get <textColor=[255:204:102:255]>Fertility</> then?",
    "20020416": "(<textColor=[255:204:102:255]>fertility</> is said to be not readily available)",

    "20020421": "Are you admitting that you attacked Master Moon?",
    "20020422": "But he's not the master of the moon. He's a monster!",
    "20020423": "Shut up! I won't let you insult Munju any more!",
    "20020424": "Listen to me...!",
    "20020425": "(I think this is where <textColor=[78:148:215:255]>Pasa</> was talking about. Let's go in)",

    "20020433": "Hey. This person! If you keep doing this, it will make each other uncomfortable. \nThe next time I can afford it, I won't be able to help.",
    "20020434": "If you say so... I see.",
    "20020435": "Ha... How about this...",
    "20020436": "Who... what are you guys?",
    "20020437": "Dude! Need <textColor=[255:204:102:255]>Cobweb</>?",
