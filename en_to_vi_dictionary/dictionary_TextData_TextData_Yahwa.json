Considering the locations where the guards are deployed, the radius of action and types of guards, etc., you can see that my hypothesis is not at all unfounded. There will be.",

However, after a while, pirates again became infested, and gradually the port where goods were being transported was lost. After that, the voices among the people of Suwol Plain that a port should be built on the southern shore of Lake Vandal grew louder and louder. He paid bribes to the field and worked hard to attract the port. In the end, it was decided to build Suwol Port at the current location due to his influence. Bandal Lake entered a period of revival due to the enormous scale of civil engineering work." ,

The emperor ordered Sang-yeon Sang-yeon to organize an expedition.\n Sang-yeon summoned generals under her command, and one of them, Seo Jung-mun, volunteered to do so. Seo Jung-mun succeeded in collecting donations in the name of giving people the rights of the new continent, and was able to organize an expedition without difficulty.

Since then, the new continent has been called by various names such as Haewoldo, Seonamdo, Taejeongdo, and Saryongdaeji, but gradually over time, the clearest name is Beyond the Sea. It came to be called 'Haewoldo', an island of In Esau, there was a debate about whether it would make sense to give the name of a continent to a land other than the four continents. However, the emperor gave it the title of 'continent' as if it was nothing special, and Haewoldo was officially called the continental continent." ,
    "51500026": "Before the current active amphibious expedition, there was another amphibious expedition that is now forgotten in people's memories. People called them 'forgotten expedition'. It refers to the expedition team of Dojeong who disappeared and crossed the sea.The leader of the expedition team, Dojeong, who returned after discovering only a barren environment, tried to stop the exploration, but suffered from pressure from the surroundings, so Dojeong came up with a plan to use criminals to explore barren land. Taojeong left with criminals on the road and never returned.\nThere are many hypotheses, but the most influential is the hypothesis that a great fight broke out between criminals and soldiers, and that most people died as a result.\nThis is said to be the place where they sprinkled alcohol to pray for good luck on their first departure, and now it is used as a place to commemorate the soul.",
    "51500027": "The disappearance of sea dragons allowed Suwol Port to develop one step further, as the port, which was primarily used for transporting offshore goods, began to become crowded with fishermen trying deep-sea fishing and expeditions exploring new seas. Also, due to the Pit of Void incident, the power of Daeeobang has weakened a lot, so I guess that it was also a big factor that influential people started investing in Suwol Port.",
    "51500029": "The exact time when the Barong first came into contact with humans has not been clarified until now. They appeared at some point and used to help by interacting with spirits that humans could not reach.\nSo The group that was created is Young Gyowon, which we can often see around us now, especially for adventurers.\nYoung Gyowon gives spiritual energy to weapons or manufactures soul stones to further enhance the skills of adventurers. Recently, it has been attracting attention from adventurers because it provides a technique to move to a distant place by grasping the energy of the earth. However, if a person with low internal strength uses this technique, there may be aftereffects, so be careful.",

Many residents have become burnt out, and the fertile lake has been divided into several parts that are barely able to keep it alive. With this article, once again I send my condolences to the countless souls involved in that.\nThe existence that appeared in the pit of the void is presumed to be a sura that has been passed down through literature. Judging from the fact that the demons poured down, it is assumed that the inside of the rift is connected to another space.\nIt is known that in addition to the fire demon called water, it is known to create a powerful entity called a flame ring, and the connection between the crack and the flame ring is also recently studied. It has been reported that flames are also moving from the inside of the rift to the outside.\nMany people have been interested in the transcendent beings that appeared in the pit of the void, but no one knows the exact information about it.",
    "51500032": "After the Pit of Void Incident, the vigilance against the existence of the Bulma became even stronger. In the meantime, the influential sect Ereda discovered this very thing. It is said that destroying fertility can dissipate the energy inside and close the fissure, the passageway for fire demons. It is said that it is difficult for ordinary residents to see the real thing other than the goods. Adventurers should also try it if there is an opportunity to see the real thing.",
    "51500034": "When I was a child, when a bountiful harvest festival was held at Lake Vandal, I used to force my parents to come to fly lanterns. .There was also a good harvest festival this year, and I came here and flew a lantern. Thinking of the forgotten person now...\nIf you were from Daeeobang, you can't know about that person. He was the one who was called. He was a man of impeccable talent, boasting of his beautiful appearance and excellent martial arts. He did not hesitate to help out and worked as a vigilante leader. The villagers also praised him as the next big fish ark.",
    "51500035": "However, the incident happened in an instant. \nThe good harvest festival of that year was unsettling from the beginning. The person's opinion to blow up the lanterns was gathered, and the lantern festival was prepared. \nBut the material for the lanterns On the last day of the festival, it was reported that the Korean papers that were stored because they needed it were burned in an unknown fire, and that those who set out to save bamboo to make lanterns were killed by a fireman. It was a mistake, and in the end, the Great Fish Ark voluntarily resigned and left the village.\nAs time passed, it was revealed that the incident at that time was the guide's mistake and led him to the pit of the void, but the person had already left the village. \nAnyway... Since then, the lanterns have been blown at every festival since then.\nNow, it may be a forgotten memory, but I still remember the incident. blows.",
    "51500036": "Currently, in the fertile land, you can see a huge topography in the shape of a sea dragon. When viewed from a distance, it looks as if the sea dragon's head is lying in the sea. Various theories have been speculated about this. However, the most credible is the theory that this continent was created after the death of the sea dragon. Of course, this hypothesis can only be established by acknowledging that the sea dragon actually existed. Exploration is underway to reveal the existence of sea dragons around the area. The Expedition Plum Blossom Team is actively establishing a base and investigating.",
    "51500037": "If you live in Taerokrim, you've probably heard of rumors about the wreckage area of shipwrecks. Pirate ships appear or ghost ships appear late at night.\nThe exact facts were investigated by Myunghyedan. As a result, it is said that small boats mainly used for smuggling or smuggling were used secretly.As you know, the sea and moon continent can only be entered through official procedures, and entry is denied at Yedo Port if your identity is not clear. It is said that the wreckage of ships that were wrecked by the tide was left unattended while trying to get in. Of course, for aesthetic or safety reasons, they tried to clear the wreckage from the weeping side, but the gloomy on the beach prevented them from undertaking the removal work. They say that they don't need to put in a separate manpower because they think everything will be weathered anyway.\nSo, I want to reveal that the rumor that there are ghost ships is false as a result of the Myunghyedan investigation! .",
    "51500038": "I've often heard in the past that when you enter this forest, you lose your mind. It's a reference. It's about a place called a forest. Although it is easy to look around, the forest is known as a place where it is easy to get lost because it is covered with strange rocks and large trees. \nBut now, it seems that this doesn't happen anymore. In the early days of pioneering, after hearing this from Younggyowon, I directly investigated the forest and discovered that a barrier with unknown power exists. It is said that the work of removing the barrier was successfully completed under the leadership of Perong.\nThanks to everyone, now everyone can see the scenery of the forest, so it wouldn't be bad for adventurers to explore this place if they have a chance. .",
    "51500039": "Those who do not disappear, we call them mortals.\nThere is still disagreement within the Myunghyedan as to when they originated. However, what has become clear is that when the rift opens, they appear around. So far, no one has confirmed what the inside of the rift is like (if there are any adventurers who have confirmed the rift or what it is inside, please let the Myunghyedan know)\nIn any case, they are confirmed to be hostile to people, so Please be careful at all times in this open area.",
    "51500041": "Have you ever seen a monster called Duong? \nSome say that you have to be alert when you meet a dark man. The anecdote of the cultivators who lost their fingers because they failed to solve the riddles they set out is unknown to anyone from the Sea and Moon Continent. \nActually, they were very mischievous, but they say they showed aggression when their home was taken away by humans. It's not that they don't understand how it feels because anyone will get angry if their home is taken away. It is said that the side is actively pushing them away.\nIf you encounter a dark person during an adventure, never panic and be alert!",
    "51500042": "When we first investigated the sea and moon continent, the tribe that stood out the most was the deer tribe called antlers. It was because of their attitude that was quite different from what was written in the history books. \nThe first expedition to this continent was When they arrived, the antlers, who had not yet shown any hostility toward humans, appeared along with their king, the giant antlers, but the expedition was frightened by the huge horns, and they dug a trap with their nets to capture them. , but after a while, the green giant ogre managed to escape with chains on with their unique agility.\nAfter that, they tightened their restraints on humans, and it is said that the green giant eagle does not appear except inside the green horned forest. . So, I urge adventurers not to approach them prematurely and arouse their anger.",
    "51500043": "I don't think there are many people who don't know about Nakwondaeseong, which is called the king of the paradise tribe. He once stayed in Suwolpyeong, but due to various big and small events, it is said that he has now crossed over to the continent.\n Even if they come to a new place, they still like to fight, so they always want to find a strong person and fight, so it's not a bad idea to challenge the Moorim people who think they're confident in their power. You know, right?\nOf course, just as the passage of time cannot be stopped by humans or beasts, Nakwondaeseong also ages...but still, it has a reputation value. Those with confidence should visit Nakwon Hills!",
    "51500044": "During the pioneering period of the sea and moon continent, the most nightmare area for the expedition would be the forest in the shade of fog. Vulnerable to environments such as thick fog, poisonous plants, and polluted water, they also lost their lives to surrounding monsters. The most feared monster would be this anti-personnel insect. Although scholars are still investigating, they still have not been able to find out exactly why the anti-personnel insect became so large.\nThey suck water from swamps and emit psychedelic mist, It is said that the person who touched it has hallucinations of an impressive person he met recently. Because they attack people who have broken their vigilance, you should not approach this area alone. I'm having a hard time finding a way to get rid of the hallucinations. Please be careful when approaching this area...",
    "51500045": "Have you ever heard of the gray jungle in the fertile land? It is said that at the beginning of the pioneering period, it was a dense jungle. After that, a huge fertility was discovered by the expedition, and it is said that there was an unfortunate accident in the process of harvesting this fertility. After that, the story of the jungle losing its original color and light and becoming the gray jungle it is today can be found in the expedition's exploration records.\nWe believe that this does not apply only to the jungle environment. It is speculated that it may have had an effect on the living creatures that had settled there. A representative example is platinum gold, which is staying in a hideout of disaster.\nIt also lost its color and light due to an unfortunate accident and is now active only in dark places. I think it may have turned into a monster, with a lot of hostility towards humans. There are still incidents where a trainee who occasionally patrols this place is killed by platinum. Finding this area out of curiosity. Please do not have this.",
    "51500046": "In the pioneering period in the past, Suyang had difficulties in securing expedition personnel, and it is said that in the end, he visited Hong Don-pal, the chief of the Hong Don tribe, and promised to provide their land in the Seawol Continent. With the participation of the Hongdon tribe, the pioneering became easier, but their promise did not end well. The rearing side took the position that they could not provide a reward because the pioneering was not finished yet, and the Hongdon tribe eventually lost patience and left the expedition. They set up on the side of the red forest road and are still fighting to keep their promises to Su-yang. Especially in the case of Hong Don-pal, the bad feelings towards Su-yang can spread to humans and cause some quarrels, so adventurers should be careful.",
    "51500048": "Most people will never have heard of the word Cheonshin Jerye. I came to know the word when I started researching Saho, and I heard it from a barong.\nThe Cheonshin Jerye literally means It means a ritual to the god of heaven. To be more specific, it can be said to be a ceremony to summon a divine beast. It is a scene that even I have never seen before, so it is not known exactly whether or not the divine beast will appear during this ceremony. It is said that three materials are needed to perform the ritual: a bell that calls the way, a mirror that illuminates the way, and a sword that makes a way can only be used to complete this ritual. nOne of my lifelong wishes is to see this ritual proceeding right before my eyes, and it is unknown whether there will ever be such a moment in my life.",
    "51500049": "In the past, Ereda was founded by a longtime Iranian warrior from Seorak. He was gradually increasing in number with his comrades Eun Gwan-hee and Yu Deok, who were called the Three Swords of Seorak, and suddenly disappeared. After that, the two remaining Ereda From then on, Ereda served the divine beast, but as the generations passed, it gradually transformed into a religious group, which was more like a religion rather than a group of uninhabited people. After that, the base of Seorak was abandoned and the base was moved to the Great Desert. This incident will later be called the starting point of the Ereda restoration movement. Emphasizing that, we put Ereda back on the ranks of the strongest unmanned group, and through amicable consultations with the elders, we finally developed into a single Ereda.",
    "51500050": "After Chobi's campaign to return to Ereda successfully ended, the Ereda became a mysterious, unmanned group of religious colors. Exploration of the sea and moon continent began around the time Ereda regained stability, but Chobi's health deteriorated. As a result, he could not participate in the expedition, and Chobi died shortly thereafter. Before the soldier, he named Harem, who was only a rip, as his replacement. There was no one there.\nHareum, who became the Munju, joined the expedition to the new continent and made splendid achievements, the most successful of which was the exploration of the Yonglin Desert.",
    "51500051": "Full of sunset, the meaning of her name. Harem showed excellent talent in both martial arts from an early age, and her swordsmanship in particular was said to be truly dazzling.\nShe was trusted by the former Munju Chobi. After that, she ascended to the position of Munju at a young age. She continued as she was after becoming Munju with a strong and active personality. In particular, joining the expedition to the new continent shows her determination. Upon hearing the news that he had been attacked, there was no group in the 2nd expedition that was willing to join the 2nd expedition. At that time, Harem expressed his intention to participate, and as a result, he achieved remarkable achievements and contributed to the success of the exploration of Yonglin Desert. Ereda called the group of dreams. People judge that it is Harum who created such a value.",
    "51500052": "Recently, the story of Harem, the master of Ereda, has been heard everywhere. I think it may have something to do with the martial arts competition that took place at Lake Vandal. Every year, Ereda participates in the festival to pray for good harvest. There is a saying that a martial arts contest was held, and Harem-nim almost stopped a huge crack at that place.\nBut after that incident, many people are worried because Harem-nim has not been seen. Rumors are circulating that he might leave Moonju's seat because of this deterioration. We went to the Ereda branch to investigate the exact facts, but we could not find a clear answer. I want you to show me.",
    "51500054": "Pungbaekmun is a sect founded by Muji Yangjung, who had a reputation for virtuous military service in the past. After rallying his followers, he made Yongoreum Valley his base.\nAs a rule, the monarch is the largest. In principle, it was the principle of succeeding the monarch of Pungbaekmun by the election of elders only when there were no children. Evil became the master.\nSongmunak is known to have tried to change the character of the clan to be open-minded with an attitude that is cooperative with the empire and approaching the people. Because it was definitely concluded, people guessed that Pungbaekmun would be the first to be invited to the expedition to the sea and moon continent, and it actually happened.",
    "51500055": "Pungbaekmun, who participated in the expedition to the sea and moon continent, will have a conflict with the Pungje Empire over huge fertility. The position of Pungbaekmun that it should be preserved as it is, and the position of Pungbaekmun that it should be mined and used is very intense. In the end, Suyang, an expedition from the Pungje Kingdom, tried to mine huge fertility without the knowledge of Pungbaekmun, but for unknown reasons, the site was destroyed. After hearing about it, they feel betrayed by Suyang, who tried to deceive them, and they are still not good friends with each other.\nBut due to this incident, Song Mun-ak has turned a passive attitude toward pioneering itself. It is said that talented people were created and, perhaps in the aftermath of this trend, Song Mun-ak gave up the current position of Mun-ju and one of the young talents took over.",
    "51500056": "Nothing has been revealed about the new master of Pungbaekmun following Song Mun-ak. However, it was expected that he was one of the young talents and that Song Si-guk, the son of Song Mun-ak, would become the master, but it greatly exceeded the expectations. In the meantime, although it has been revealed which family will take over the position of the monarch, not even the surname or name is known about this monarch.\nMany people speculate, for some reason it cannot be disclosed. There are rumors that the person with the stylist may have become the owner of the gate, or the fact that it was vacant, but could not reveal it, so a person who did not exist was set up as a fiction. Whether or not it is fiction is unknown.",
    "51500057": "One of the most impressive discoveries in the process of pioneering the sea and moon continent is huge fertility. It was a Pung Empire that I never expected to find a fertility of this size, so with this opportunity, the Pung Empire has been able to contribute more to the pioneering of the sea and moon continent. I started investing money.\nWhen the giant fertility was discovered, the conflict between Suyang and Pungbaekmun was intense, so the mining of the giant fertility was delayed. But in fact, in fact, in private, Suyang mined the giant fertility little by little. This fact was revealed by a mysterious incident. One day, an incident occurred in which the area around huge fertilization was devastated with a huge crack. The cause is still unknown, but people all tried to secretly mine the giant fertility. They accused him of buying the wrath of God.\nNow, it has turned into a place infested with fire demons, and no one dares to approach the area around the great fertility. To me, it seems like the end of greed.",
    "51500058": "There were many incidents that Pungbaekmun experienced during the expedition to the sea and moon continents, but the foggy marsh avalanche was one of them. It was a nightmare for the expeditionary team during the pioneering period. Because of this, an endemic disease broke out. There were not one or two people who collapsed from an endemic disease due to the poor understanding of the topography. Thanks to an expedition member named Sarubi, he made medicinal herbs from plants that can cope with endemic diseases, and the expedition progressed safely. However, it is said that those who had already lost their lives in the process were gathered and buried in one place, dividing the rams into two rams and the Pungbaekmun by the same name, without being able to properly name them. It's an area. Even now, if you go there, you can hear the cries of the souls of that time, so it's recorded as a heartbreaking event.",
    "51500059": "One of the questions that many people ask! If Pungbaekmun and Ereda fight, who wins? This is often talked about and asked.\nOf course, whoever knows the answer... No, because the two factions have never had a formal confrontation. Besides, Harem, the owner of Ereda, has already appeared, but little is known about the master of Pungbaekmun, so it often stimulates curiosity.\nComparison standards It's hard to say, but Pungbaekmun joined the 1st expedition and Ereda joined the 2nd expedition, so Poongbaekmun wins in the order of joining!
